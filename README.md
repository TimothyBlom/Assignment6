# Getting Started with Create React App
For this assignment, as we understand it, we need to make a translation app that translate text to emoji's of hand signals.
You can also log in and view and delete your 10 last translation requests.

## How to use
- You start in the login page, type in your name and press the go button.
- You are now in the translation page, type in what you would like to have translated and press the go button.
- Notice in the top right of the screen your profile name and a log out button.
- Click on your profile name to go to the profile page.
- In the profile page you can see your 10 last translate requests and a button to delete them.
- In the top left of the screen you see a image and the text Lost in translation, click on it to return to the translation page.
- Click on the log out button to log out and return to the log in page.
